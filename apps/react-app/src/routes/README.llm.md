# Routes

This directory contains all route definitions for the React app using TanStack Router's file-based routing.

## File-Based Routing

TanStack Router uses file-based routing where:

- File names determine route paths
- `__root.tsx` creates the root route and layout
- `index.tsx` creates the `/` route
- Other files create routes matching their name (e.g., `about.tsx` → `/about`)

## Modules

### `apps/react-app/src/routes/__root.tsx`

Root route that provides the application layout and navigation.

**Exports**:

- `Route` - Root route configuration created with `createRootRoute`

**Component Features**:

- Navigation links to Home and About pages
- Renders `<Outlet />` for child routes
- Provides consistent layout styling

**Dependencies**:

- `@tanstack/react-router` - Router library (`createRootRoute`, `Link`, `Outlet`)

**Gotchas**:

- Must be named `__root.tsx` (double underscore prefix)
- Must export a `Route` constant created with `createRootRoute`
- Uses `<Outlet />` to render child routes

### `apps/react-app/src/routes/index.tsx`

Home page route at `/`.

**Exports**:

- `Route` - File route configuration created with `createFileRoute('/')`

**Component Features**:

- Displays app name and environment variables
- Demonstrates package1 utilities (add, capitalize, formatCurrency)

**Dependencies**:

- `@tanstack/react-router` - Router library (`createFileRoute`)
- `package1` - Shared utilities package

**Gotchas**:

- Must be named `index.tsx` to create the root `/` route
- Uses `createFileRoute('/')` to define the route path

### `apps/react-app/src/routes/about.tsx`

About page route at `/about`.

**Exports**:

- `Route` - File route configuration created with `createFileRoute('/about')`

**Component Features**:

- Simple about page with app information

**Dependencies**:

- `@tanstack/react-router` - Router library (`createFileRoute`)

**Gotchas**:

- File name determines route path (`about.tsx` → `/about`)
- Uses `createFileRoute('/about')` to define the route path

## Route Tree Generation

The route tree is automatically generated by `@tanstack/router-vite-plugin` during development and build:

- Generated file: `apps/react-app/src/routeTree.gen.ts`
- Do not edit this file manually - it's auto-generated
- The plugin scans this directory and creates the route tree based on file structure

## Adding New Routes

To add a new route:

1. Create a new file in this directory (e.g., `contact.tsx`)
2. Export a `Route` constant using `createFileRoute('/contact')`
3. The route will be automatically included in the route tree
4. Access the route at `/contact`

## Relationships

- `apps/react-app/src/main.tsx` imports the generated route tree and creates router instance
- All routes are children of `__root.tsx` which provides the layout
- Routes can use `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router` for navigation
